The solution involves using techniques to ensure proper reference counting and avoid double release or premature release.  One approach involves using toll-free bridging to convert the `CFStringRef` to an `NSString`, leveraging Objective-C's automatic reference counting (ARC):

```objectivec
NSString *myString = (__bridge NSString *)CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, "Hello, world!", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);
// ... some operations with myString ...
// ARC handles the release automatically.
```

Alternatively, if ARC is not used, manual reference counting with careful attention to `CFRetain` and `CFRelease` is necessary to maintain proper balance, ensuring that `CFRelease` is called only once per `CFRetain`.

Another robust solution is to use `CFBridgingRelease` after the conversion to `NSString` when ARC is not used to prevent over-releasing.  Using `CFBridgingRetain` is usually preferred before the bridge to avoid any premature releasing. This approach provides a cleaner and safer way to manage Core Foundation objects within Objective-C.

This example demonstrates a crucial aspect of memory management in Objective-C and the importance of understanding the nuances of Core Foundation object lifecycle.
