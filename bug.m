In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with Core Foundation objects.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
CFStringRef myString = CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, "Hello, world!", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);
// ... some operations with myString ...
CFRelease(myString);
```

The bug lies in the potential for double-release or premature release of `myString`.  If `myString` was already released elsewhere (possibly through a retained copy), calling `CFRelease` again would lead to a crash. Conversely, if further operations retained `myString` after the `CFRelease` line, it would lead to a memory leak.  The subtle aspect is that errors in other parts of the code, unrelated to this specific line, could trigger the issue, making debugging harder.
