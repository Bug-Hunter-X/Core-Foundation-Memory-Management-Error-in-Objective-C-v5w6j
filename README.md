# Objective-C Core Foundation Memory Management Bug

This repository demonstrates a common subtle bug in Objective-C related to Core Foundation memory management. Specifically, it highlights the risks of double-releasing or prematurely releasing Core Foundation objects, such as CFStringRef.

The `bug.m` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.  The core issue involves the potential for double-release, leading to crashes, or premature release, leading to memory leaks. Proper handling requires careful attention to object ownership and lifecycle.
